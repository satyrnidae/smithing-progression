# Foxcraft Custom Additions

A simple data pack which adds several recipes and additional functionality to the game

## New crafting recipes

This data pack adds an assortment of recipes for previously uncraftable items. As of v3.1.1, recipes for the following items have been added:

- Bells
- Chainmail armor
- Elytra
- Enchanted golden apples
- Name tags
- Saddles
- Tridents
- Warped wart from warped root
- Warped root from warped wart
- Red and brown mushroom blocks from red or brown mushrooms or mushroom stems
- Mushroom stem from red or brown mushroom blocks

## Actually useful smithing

Tool and armor upgrade paths have been added for non-netherite materials (excluding gold for various reasons including negative-durability items and vastly gold's greatly boosted enchantability).

### Tool upgrade path
```
wood -> stone -> iron -> diamond
```
Wood is upgraded to stone via cobblestone or blackstone, stone is upgraded to iron with an iron ingot, and iron is upgraded to diamond with... well, diamonds.

### Armor upgrade path
```
leather -> chainmail -> iron -> diamond
```
Leather to chainmail and chainmail to iron are both achieved with an iron ingot. Iron to diamond uses diamonds, as above.

### Horse armor
```
leather -> iron -> diamond
```
Added for completeness. The upgrade paths are the same as normal armor, but leather will upgrade directly to iron.

## Shapeless redyeing

Vanilla dyeing recipes have been replaced with shapeless, any-color variants for the following blocks:

- Wool
- Terracotta
- Stained Glass / Panes

Bulk dyeing for wool (8x wool, 1x dye) and single-block dyeing for terracotta and stained glass have also been added for completeness.
